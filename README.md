## Week-1: Introduction to Neural Networks
In this first week, we will provide an overview of neural networks, their applications, and how to get started with PyTorch. Neural networks have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and are widely used in various domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and more. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals of neural networks and learn how to build, train, and deploy neural networks using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework.
